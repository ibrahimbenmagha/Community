                <p>Anime (Japanese: アニメ, IPA: [aɲime] (About this soundlisten)) is hand-drawn and computer animation originating from Japan.
                    In Japan and in Japanese, anime (a term derived from the English word animation) describes all animated works, regardless 
                    of style or origin. However, outside of Japan and in English, anime is colloquial for Japanese animation and refers
                    specifically to animation produced in Japan Animation produced outside of Japan with similar style to Japanese
                    animation is referred to as anime-influenced animation.The earliest commercial Japanese animations date to 1917. 
                    A characteristic art style emerged in the 1960s with the works of cartoonist Osamu Tezuka and spread in following decades,
                    developing a large domestic audience. Anime is distributed theatrically, through television broadcasts, directly to home 
                    media, and over the Internet. In addition to original works, anime are often adaptations of Japanese comics (manga), light
                    novels, or video games. It is classified into numerous genres targeting various broad and niche audiences.</p>
                    <h2 class="titres">History</h2>
                    <p>Emakimono and kagee are considered precursors of Japanese animation. Emakimono was common in the eleventh century. 
                        Traveling storytellers narrated legends and anecdotes while the emakimono was unrolled from the right to left with 
                        chronological order, as a moving panorama. Kagee was popular during the Edo period and originated from the shadows 
                        play of China. Magic lanterns from the Netherlands were also popular in the eighteenth century. The paper play 
                        called Kamishibai surged in the twelfth century and remained popular in the street theater until the 1930s. Puppets
                        of the bunraku theater and ukiyo-e prints are considered ancestors of characters of most Japanese animations. 
                        Finally, mangas were a heavy inspiration for Japanese anime. Cartoonists Kitzawa Rakuten and Okamoto Ippei used film 
                        elements in their strips.
                        Animation in Japan began in the early 20th century, when filmmakers started to experiment with techniques pioneered 
                        in France, Germany, the United States, and Russia. A claim for the earliest Japanese animation is Katsudō Shashin 
                        (c. 1907), a private work by an unknown creator. In 1917, the first professional and publicly displayed works 
                        began to appear; animators such as Ōten Shimokawa, Seitarō Kitayama, and Jun'ichi Kōuchi (considered the "fathers 
                        of anime") produced numerous films, the oldest surviving of which is Kōuchi's Namakura Gatana. Many early works 
                        were lost with the destruction of Shimokawa's warehouse in the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake.
                        By the mid-1930s animation was well-established in Japan as an alternative format to the live-action industry. 
                        It suffered competition from foreign producers, such as Disney, and many animators, including Noburō Ōfuji and 
                        Yasuji Murata, continued to work with cheaper cutout animation rather than cel animation. Other creators, 
                        including Kenzō Masaoka and Mitsuyo Seo, nevertheless made great strides in technique, benefiting from the patronage 
                        of the government, which employed animators to produce educational shorts and propaganda. In 1940, the government 
                        dissolved several artists' organizations to form the Shin Nippon Mangaka Kyōkai. The first talkie anime 
                        was Chikara to Onna no Yo no Naka (1933), a short film produced by Masaoka. The first feature-length 
                        anime film was Momotaro: Sacred Sailors (1945), produced by Seo with a sponsorship from the Imperial Japanese Navy.
                        The 1950s saw a proliferation of short, animated
